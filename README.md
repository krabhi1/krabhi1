## Abhishek

I'm passionate about becoming a skilled programmer, particularly focused on building real-time collaboration systems, scalable architectures, and secure backend solutions. I also enjoy creating multiplayer games.

I can work with C++, Python, TypeScript, and SQL, and I want to learn Go and Rust.

I'm working on a real-time chat app focusing on scalability and end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to handle 10,000 concurrent users using Bun.
